AI-Powered Interview Preparation Tool
Project Overview
The AI-Powered Interview Preparation Tool provides job seekers with an interactive platform to practice interview questions tailored to specific roles, industries, or skill sets. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), this tool delivers constructive feedback to users on their responses, helping them refine their communication skills and build interview confidence.

Objective
This project simulates realistic interview scenarios where users can:

Receive job-specific interview questions.
Practice structured responses in a simulated interview environment.
Obtain immediate feedback on their responses to enhance clarity, relevance, and structure.
Problem to Solve
Preparing for interviews can be challenging, especially when it comes to practicing verbal responses. Although many platforms provide written content, few offer real-time practice opportunities with feedback. This tool addresses that gap by offering users a hands-on, interactive experience to improve verbal communication skills.
